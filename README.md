I developed a RESTful API using Spring MVC to support user registration, menu browsing, and order placement. Hibernate was integrated for database interactions, ensuring efficient data management, while Spring Security was implemented to handle authentication. The application follows Spring's core principles to maintain a loosely coupled architecture.

On the frontend, I built the user interface with ReactJS and Ant Design, allowing users to browse menus, add items to their cart, and complete orders.
